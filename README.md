# API & UI Automation with Serenity/JS

## Note
This assignment is using Serenity/JS which is a next generation full-stack acceptance testing framework with the ability to automate both functional API and UI tests. You can learn more at [serenity-js.org](https://serenity-js.org).

## Test Plan

The following test categories have been briefly identified. In a real world scenario, a [Visual Task Analysis*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ThrYRcO3zs3uaxuJXUSlbFClTqQAKYqd/view) and/or a [Mind Map*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SkstPU4XvY-TbGifzT9HBi4bn0tgjpUr/view) would have been used for modelling the system as well as identifying and oragnising more testing categories. The Visual Task Analysis in combination with the Serenity-JS would have provided an API + UI automation solution under the same framework. *The illustrations are given only as a general reference.
